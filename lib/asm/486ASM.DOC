Please distribute all of the assembler files together.  This file covers
version 1.24.  When distributing modified versions of this assembler, please
make sure that all modifications are clearly labeled as such.

This document assumes that the reader is familiar with both FORTH and assembly
language programming on the Intel(R) platform.

Although the assembler is written for Andrew McKewan and Tom Zimmer's FORTH
for Windows 95 and NT, it should be portable to other operating environments
with minimal trouble.  The author would love to hear about such ports.

*	Support for all documented Intel(R) Pentium(tm) instructions
*	Includes the RDTSC instruction (which is documented by Intel(R) in the
		infamous ``Appendix H'', but described in several other
		places).
*	Includes support for the 386 & 486 Test registers.
*	User configurable code generation
		The user can select default 16 bit or default 32 bit code
		Automatically handles address and operand size overrides

Contributors:
These people have helped this project enormously in one way or another:
Andrew McKewan -- wrote the kernel and wrapper for the FORTH system I now
	use almost exclusively.
Tom Zimmer -- souped up that kernel to tremendous heights.  He also nagged
	me enough to get me to write the assembler in the first place.  If
	that isn't enough, he is also the major distributor of the assembler.
Bob Smith -- pointed out some subtle bugs in the floating point words.
Steven M. Brault -- found all of the bugs that were fixed in 1.22.
Anton Ertl -- Pointed out that my previous version of SET-ASSEMBLER-ORDER
	didn't work.
Andrey Cherezov -- found a bug concerning PUSH # <data>.
Vladimir F. Ibatulin -- found a bug concerning operand sizes for I/O
        instructions.

Standard compliance:
This program is substantially compliant with the ANS for the FORTH
programming language, with these exceptions:

This program is expected to be compiled on a system where upper and lower
cases are equivalent.  A conversion to uppercase may be required to make
this program portable to your FORTH system.

The words DEFER, DEFER@ and IS, as used in this program, are substantially
the same as the standard code stream:
``: NOOP ;
: DEFER CREATE ['] NOOP , DOES> @ EXECUTE ;
: DEFER@ ' >BODY STATE @ IF POSTPONE LITERAL POSTPONE @ ELSE @ THEN ; IMMEDIATE
: IS ' STATE @ IF POSTPONE LITERAL POSTPONE ! ELSE ! THEN ; IMMEDIATE''

The word +TO, as used in this program, is intended to add the number on the
stack to the stored value of the VALUE following it in the code stream.  If
VALUE is defined as:
``: VALUE CREATE , DOES> @ ;''
and TO is defined as:
``: TO ' >BODY STATE @ IF POSTPONE LITERAL POSTPONE ! ELSE ! THEN ; IMMEDIATE''
then a working definition of +TO would be:
``: +TO ' >BODY STATE @ IF POSTPONE LITERAL POSTPONE +! ELSE +! THEN ;
IMMEDIATE''
Unfortunately, this word has no standard implementation.

The words ASSEMBLER, ASM-HIDDEN, IN-FORTH, IN-ASM, and IN-HIDDEN, as used and
defined in this program, are substantially the same as the standard code stream:
``FORTH-WORDLIST SET-CURRENT
WORDLIST CONSTANT ASSEMBLER-WORDLIST
: ASSEMBLER GET-ORDER ASSEMBLER-WORDLIST ROT DROP SWAP SET-ORDER ;
ASSEMBLER-WORDLIST SET-CURRENT
WORDLIST CONSTANT HIDDEN-WORDLIST
: ASM-HIDDEN GET-ORDER HIDDEN-WORDLIST ROT DROP SWAP SET-ORDER ;
HIDDEN-WORDLIST SET-CURRENT
: SET-ASSEMBLER-ORDER ONLY GET-ORDER FORTH-WORDLIST SWAP HIDDEN-WORDLIST
                      ASSEMBLER-WORDLIST ROT 3 + SET-ORDER ;
: IN-FORTH SET-ASSEMBLER-ORDER FORTH-WORDLIST SET-CURRENT ;
: IN-ASM SET-ASSEMBLER-ORDER ASSEMBLER-WORDLIST SET-CURRENT ;
: IN-HIDDEN SET-ASSEMBLER-ORDER HIDDEN-WORDLIST SET-CURRENT ;''

The words prefixed with ``CODE-'' act directly on the target dictionary, and
have no standard implementation.  If your FORTH system does not provide words
to directly alter the contents of the dictionary, this assembler is not
portable to your system.

The words that are implied by the defered words CODE, ;CODE, SUBR:, and
END-CODE make several assumptions about the FORTH system in general, and the
dictionary in particular.  The header creation words, compiler security, and
more esoteric vocabulary manipulations have either non-trivial or no standard
implementation.  If your system does not provide comparable words, this
assembler is not directly portable to your system.

The assembler source fragment ``CURRENT DATA-@'' is equivalent to the
standard code stream ``GET-CURRENT'', while the assembler source code fragment
``CURRENT DATA-!'' is equivalent to the standard code stream ``SET-CURRENT''

The assembler assumes that items on the stack are at least 32 bits long.

The assembler requires the words ALSO, FORTH, ONLY, and PREVIOUS from the
search order extension wordset.

The redifinition of EXIT in the ASSEMBLER vocabulary is non-standard.  First,
it tracks macro nesting so that EXIT can be used in macros.  Second, using it
from the console is effectively a no-op.

Bugs:
One of the truely wonderful things about FORTH is the ease with which bugs can
be isolated and killed.  During this project, the average time to design and
enter 10k of source code was about 6 hours, while the average time to debug
10k of source code was about 1 hour.  For a C program of comparable complexity,
the times would be about 8 hours and 8 hours, respectively.  (Of course, the
average time to *document* 10k of source code was ...) Thus, FORTH code can be
somewhat more bug free than comparable C code.  Still, I'm virtually certain
that somewhere in all my beautiful code someone will find a really obvious,
obnoxious bug.

If you find a bug, I really want to hear about it, provided it is:
1. Reproducible -- If I can't find it on my system, I can't fix it. At a
minimum, I need to know which version of the assembler you are using, which
FORTH it is running on, exactly what conditions cause it to manifest, and
what you think the error is.
2. Actually in my code -- If you (or someone else) modified the assembler,
you're on your own.  I'm sorry, but I really don't have time to wade through
several pages of assembler source code to find that you mistook al for ax.
This does not apply if you use the provided words to change the behavior of
the assembler, however (things like turning off error reporting, etc.).
As another caution:  Tom's interpreter may do strange things with words that
aren't found in the search order.  For example, the word ``L$11:'', which is
not defined in my assembler, but looks a lot like one of my local labels, will
be interpreted as a method selector, and give you a truly strange error
message.
3. Actually a bug -- If the assembler incorrectly turns semantically well
formed statements into machine code, that is a bug.  However, although I
tried to catch the most obvious errors, the assembler is free to create bogus
machine code from semantically incorrect statements.  This is not a bug of
the assembler, but a problem with whoever tried to assemble the garbage in
the first place.  Related to this: turning off error reporting will leave the
stack balanced if you encounter an error, but it will almost certainly
produce bogus code.

To report a bug that fits the above conditions, send me e-mail to
japs@netcom.com.  Please make bug reports as detailed as possible, and
send it with a subject line of ``bug report 486asm.f''.  If you don't
have e-mail access, you can send a letter to me in care of Frank Hall,
POBox 14162 Oakland, CA 94614.  Since this method is slower (and more
likely to cost me money), the e-mail method is preferred.  I will reply
to either in the same manner.

Enhancements, Bug fixes:
If you have an enhancement or bug fix, I definitely want to hear from you.
Send a diff with an indication of which version it applies to the e-mail
address above.  If you can't create a diff, compress and uuencode the
entire (modified) assembler and e-mail it to me.  If you don't have e-mail,
you can mail me either a diff (hard copy or disc) or the entire assembler
(disc only, please) at the US mail address given above.  If I incorporate
the change in a future version, you'll be the first to get a copy, and I'll
acknowledge your contribution in the new version.  If you send me an entire
assembler, please clearly indicate what was changed and why.  If you send
me a hard copy of an entire assembler, however, it will probably be a loooong
time before I get a chance to look at it.  I can only read 3.5" PC floppies.

Installation:
The source file (486ASM.F) must be somewhere that your FORTH system can find
it.  For Win32FORTH, this is the same directory in which the FORTH system
files reside.  To load the assembler in Win32FORTH, type (at the FORTH
command line) ``fload 486asm.f''  Other FORTHs may be different.  Check
the documentation that came with your system.  That's all there is to it.

To load the optional macro package ``ASMMAC.F'', the FORTH word calling
routines in ``VCALL.F'', or the Win32 FORTH specific macros in ``ASMWIN32.F'',
you must follow a similar process.

If you received this assembler as part of Tom Zimmer's and Andrew McKewan's
FORTH for Windows 95 and NT, it's already installed.  To install an updated
version, you need to run the FORTH kernel and load the file ``EXTEND.F''.
Currently, running the Windows command line (either from the Run... menu
item or an icon) ``FKERNEL FLOAD EXTEND.F BYE'' does the trick.

Notes for users of FORTH systems other than Win32FORTH:
If your system does not already contain an ASSEMBLER vocabulary, remove the
parens around the phrase ``( vocabulary assembler )'' in the source code.
The virtual call instructions assembled in ``VCALL.F'' probably won't work
on your system without modification.

Why this is under the FSF's GPL:
I am currently distributing this assembler under the terms of the Free
Software Foundation's General Public License for two related reasons.  The
first is that, while I respect and envy Tom Zimmer's skill at transmuting
other's work into something that is convenient for him to use, this assembler
is my baby, and I don't want him to mess with it too much.  Since the GPL
specifically permits (and actually encourages) that covered software be
experimented with, as long as all distributed copies carry conspicuous notice
of where they were modified, this allows Tom to hack away to his heart's
content, but gives me ultimate control over what hackery I will support.

Second, because I want this assembler to be useful to the widest range of
users, I want the users to have some gaurantee that they will be able to do
just about whatever they want to with it, but I still want some control over
the eventual outcome of the process.

Creating primatives:
The word CODE creates the header for an executable low-level word, puts the
ASSEMBLER vocabulary in the search order, and does miscellaneous prep for
assembly.  By default, the assembly syntax is operator-operands (eg. MOV
AX , BX).  This can be changed by executing POSTFIX in the ASSEMBLER
vocabulary, and changed back with PREFIX.  Because of the timing
considerations involved (prefix mode works by doing the assembly an
instruction late), these words should be executed only before code is actually
generated, or right after the word ``A;''.  By default, the assembler
generates 32 bit code.  This can be changed by executing USE16 or USE32.
These should also only be used before code is generated, or right after the
word ``A;''.  Operands must be separated with a freestanding comma (",").
Numeric constants are assumed to be addresses unless they are preceded by a
"#".  Assembly is ended with the word END-CODE or ;C.

If you load the optional macro package ``ASMMAC.F'', commas can be combined
with their preceding operands, provided that operand is not a numeric value.
For example, if you load ``ASMMAC.F'', the code fragment:
	MOV EAX, # ' FOO
	MOV ECX, [EAX] [EDI]
is equivalent to:
	MOV EAX , # ' FOO
	MOV ECX , [EAX] [EDI]

Creating subroutines:
The word SUBR: creates the header for a subroutine in the ASSEMBLER vocabulary,
puts the ASSEMBLER vocabulary in the search order, and does miscellaneous prep
for assembly.  The subroutine's header can only be found during subsequent
assembly.  Subsequent execution of the subroutine's name leaves the address
of the subroutine on the stack.  Other than that, the subroutine is treated
exactly like a CODE definition, as far as the assembler is concerned.

Creating macros:
The word MACRO: essentially does the same thing as the word :, with some
chicanery with the search order.  It also initializes the macro-scoped local
labels (discussed below). MACROs are created in the ASSEMBLER vocabulary.
Macros are ended with either ENDM or ;MACRO (or ;M, if you load the optional
macro package ASMMAC.F).  Since macros are essentially colon definitions, no
(machine) code is actually generated by defining them, but rather by invoking
them.

Because of the way parameters on the stack are handled by the assembler, any
parameters to the macro should be saved onto the return stack before the first
assembly instruction, and popped from it as needed.  Register parameters *MUST*
be removed from the operand stack and saved until they are needed.  When they
are to be used, they *MUST* be pushed back onto the operand stack.  The words
to do this are POP-OP and PUSH-OP.  Finally, any non-assembly code *MUST*
leave the stack balanced.

Unless the macro parses for its own parameters, the parameters have to be
available before the macro is invoked.  Note: passing in a local label to
a macro won't work!  The local label handler will assume that the label
is used by the first instruction assembled after the label is invoked.
However, parsing a local label out of the input stream and executing it in
the macro will work.

The word SET-POSTFIX safely sets the assembler syntax to postfix, and returns
a flag to tell the which mode the assembler was in previously.  The word
RESET-SYNTAX restores the assembler syntax to the way it was before.
Bracketing your macro code with ``SET-POSTFIX >R'' and ``R> RESET-SYNTAX''
will insure that the macro is executed in postfix mode.  The word SET-PREFIX
works similarly, and returns a flag that is compatible with SET-POSTFIX.
Because no machine code is generated until your macro is executed, I strongly
suggest that your macros assume that the syntax is unknown until they
explicitly set it.

Notice for those of you who plan on using the assembler as part of a cross-
compiler:  If your cross-compiler uses the same three state approach that the
Nautilus System's figFORTH cross-compiler used, macros will severely mess with
your mind.  The timing relationships envolved are non-trivial, and mostly
counter-intuitive.  This is because at macro definition time, the system is
in the compiling state, and compiling into the host dictionary, while when the
macro is being invoked, the system is in assembling state, and assembly code is
being generated in the target.  I suspect that most problems will come about
because assembling and interpreting state are similar, but different enough to
cause problems.

Using local labels:
Local labels can be used anywhere a branch destination address can appear.
Local labels have two forms:  definition scoped labels and macro scoped
labels.  Definition scoped label references have the form ``@@n'', where
n is a digit from 1 to 9.  Macro scoped label references have the form
``@@Mn'', where n is a digit from 0 to 9, or alternately, ``L$n''.  Labels
are bound to a particular address by word of the form ``@@n:'' for definition
scoped labels and ``@@Mn:'' or ``L$n:'' for macro scoped labels.  As the
designation implies, definition scoped labels are "visible" throughout the
entire definition in which they occur, including in any macros used in the
definition.  It's not an error to bind a label more than once.  It is (usually)
benign for a macro to reference a definition scoped label, but (usually) a
bad idea for a macro to bind a definition scoped label.  For example, in the
code fragment:
``MACRO: DELAY ( x -- ) SET-POSTFIX >R >R
        MOV ECX , # R>
        @@1: LOOP @@1
        >R RESTORE-SYNTAX
ENDM
CODE FOO ( -- )
        ...
        30 DELAY
        JMP @@1
	...''
the label @@1 is bound in the macro DELAY, which will cause FOO to go into
an infinite loop.  For this reason, the assembler also provides macro
scoped labels.  They can safely be used anywhere, including at definition
scope.    Since their scope disappears with the macro that invoked them,
they can be the source of some subtle errors, however.  For example, if
one macro references a label but doesn't bind it, and another macro at the
same lexical level references and binds the label,  that binding will also be
effective for the earlier macro.  If the macros are reversed, the reference in
the later macro will never be resolved.

The macro scoped labels come in two forms because Tom Zimmer is fond of the
alternate syntax.  The words ``@@Mn'' and ``L$n'', where n is the same digit
for both, are identical, and similar remarks apply to ``@@Mn:'' and ``L$n:''.
They are macro scoped because macro scoped labels are more flexible.

Also, binding a label in the middle of an instruction is a bad idea.  Because
the label binder forces the previous instruction to finish assembling, this
code fragment:
	ADD EBX, [EAX] @@1: [EDI]
	ADD CL, 4 [EBP]
will actually appear to the assembler as:
	ADD EBX, [EAX]
	@@1: ADD [EDI] CL, 4 [EBP]
This kind of error (while obvious in this example) may (or may not)
generate a "bad addressing mode" error.  Although it is possible to bind
a local label to the address of, say, a mod-r/m byte, it requires somewhat
subtle hackery, and it's generally a fairly bad idea.

Also, the local labels are *code* labels.  Currently, there is no way to
create a local label to a data item (and I have no immediate plans to
implement one...).

If you need more than 10 macro scoped local labels, increase the value
MACRO-LABELS to the number of labels that you need, and use the words
CREATE-MACRO-REF and CREATE-MACRO-BIND (in the ASM-HIDDEN vocabulary) to create
the local label reference and binding words.  Each takes a number from the
stack.  The numbers 0 through 9 are already in use, so the new reference
and binding words must use parameters in the range 10 to the new value
in MACRO-LABELS, minus one.  By doing this, you also increase the space
available for definition scoped local labels.  The reference and binding
words for definition scoped local labels are created with CREATE-REF and
CREATE-BIND respectively (again, in the ASM-HIDDEN vocabulary).  The words
that control label scoping, referencing and binding are in the ASM-HIDDEN
vocabulary.  If you have deeply nested macros, you may also need to increase
the constant LBMAX in the source code and recompile.  If need more than 256
unresolved references to local labels, increase the constant FRMAX in the
source code and recompile. "Out of the box", the assembler supports macros
nested up to 28 levels deep.

Controlling error reporting:
The error handling words are all DEFERed.  This is done, rather than having
them check a status variable, to permit finer control over which errors are
reported.  The word NO-ERRORS turns off error reporting, while the word
REPORT-ERRORS turns on error reporting.  Error checking words can be turned
on or off individually, with judicious hacking.  Either of the built in words
to control error handling and reporting will put the error checking words
in a known state.  If you need to individually turn off or on error words,
I strongly encourage you to read the source code for both the error word
itself and NO-ERRORS and REPORT-ERRORS so you know how many parameters your
error handler is expected to deal with.  Also, you can't turn off errors
associated with table or stack overflows (currently dealing with forward
referenced local labels and the operand stack) without either changing the
source code or catching the interpreter that is running the assembler.  As
a final caveat, some of the ``error handling'' words also set flags in the
assembler.  One point: in postfix mode (the default) reports are delayed until
after the next instruction in the code stream is encountered.  This is due
to the way that FORTH processes words.  This is not a bug of the assembler,
but a language feature that is more troublesome to work around than it
is worth.

Use as a cross-assembler:
All of the words that generate actual code or headers to be found in the
target are DEFERed.  The assembler can be retooled as a cross-assembler with
minimal difficulty.  Simply redirect all of the words that start with
``CODE-'' to use words that operate on the intended target address space.
You will also have to define words analogous to CODE, ;CODE, END-CODE, and
;C to create headers in the target.

Of course, the cross-assembler will still only generate code for a 486.

Late note:  I now know for a fact that the assembler can be loaded as a
cross assembler with as little as 65 lines of support code, because I've done
it.

I have also added the word REGISTER-REF to the ASM-HIDDEN vocabulary to
facilitate out of scope forward references.  This word takes a number and a
type from the parameter stack and returns the number.  It is called by the
words that compile displacements and immediate data.  The type values are
also defined in ASM-HIDDEN.  In the out-of-the-box assembler, REGISTER-REF
just discards the type value.  It is intended for use in a cross-assembler.

Calling FORTH words from assembly language:
If you are using Win32FORTH, you can use the words defined in the file
``VCALL.F'' to call FORTH words from assembly language.  The macro FCALL
is defined to allow you to do this conveniently.  It parses the input
stream for a word name, and causes this code to be assembled:
	MOV EAX, # (xt of word name)
	CALL VCALL
If you are trying to call unnamed words, you must move the execution token
of the word into the eax register yourself, and assemble a call to VCALL.
VCALL expects that the eax register contains a valid execution token, and
the top of the machine stack contains a valid return address.

Note: because FCALL parses the input stream, you must provide a word name.
Also, this performs absolutely no error checking.  Calling VCALL with a
random value in EAX will almost certainly raise an exception.

On the misfeatures:
Some bonehead errors won't be caught.  Of course, if you wanted all of your
boneheaded errors caught, you'd be programming in a boneheaded language...
The solution supported by the assembler is simple: Don't DO that!

For example, using a local label as a data address won't be caught, and will
mung your code.  The reason:  I didn't feel like coding RESOLVE to look for
every single possible branch.  It looks for 0e8h, 0e9h, or 0fh to decide if
the offset is NEAR or SHORT.  Since the 486 uses relative branches, the
address put into the operand slot will be incorrect.  And since almost all of
the instructions that take memory operands also require a mod-r/m byte,
BACKPATCH will be off by one, anyway...

Further, not all addressing modes are supported for all instructions.  In
particular, IMUL only supports the implied AL/AX/EAX, register/memory
addressing mode.  Also, instructions with implied operands don't handle
them consistently when they are present in the code.  For example, LODS
will check for [SI] or [ESI], to determine the address size, but it won't
check for AL, etc., and MUL only checks for AL, etc. if it can't determine
the size of the second operand.  This will (hopefully) be fixed in a later
version.

A related problem is that the assembler doesn't fully screen all addressing
modes.  For example, the assembler will accept as perfectly reasonable the
fragment ``JMP CS: [ECX] @@1'', which will be clobbered by the local label
binder when @@1 is bound.  Since it has a segment override (and maybe an
address size prefix, which is accounted for in the local label binder), which
is not one of the three cases the local label binder looks for as a NEAR
offset, it will patch the opcode byte for JMP with the displacement from the
mod-r/m byte to the bound address of @@1.  The case when @@1 is already bound
is not quite as spectacular, as @@1 will be used as a displacement from ECX,
which will result in effectively ``JMP CS:[ECX+@@1-HERE]''.  When the segment
override is absent, the binder will patch the mod-r/m byte with the offset
from the displacement field to the address of @@1.  This is one of the class
of the most spectacular errors that can be generated.  Some coding errors
actually generate valid object code.  For example, the fragment ``FIST
QWORD [EAX]'' will actually assemble as ``FBSTP TBYTE [EAX]''.  Since FIST
does not support a QWORD memory operand, the error is in the code, not the
assembler.

Also, the assembler doesn't generate the world's tightest code.  That's
because the assembler is complicated enough without having it check for
every special case.  If there's both a register, reg/mem and an (e)ax,
reg/mem form of the instruction, the register, reg/mem form will also
work if the register is (e)ax.  However, the assembler is smart enough not
to assemble an unnecessary zero offset.  Even so, just the support routines
are larger than an 8086 assembler I wrote, which was more than twice as large
as the first assembler I wrote.  (Of course, most of that overhead is for
things like local labels, flexible code generation, and flexible error
handling...  Still, the assembler _is_ larger than any other source file in
the Win32FORTH distribution, except for the fkernel.f file...)

Unsupported instructions:
Currently, all Intel(R) documented assembly mnemonics are supported, but not
all addressing modes are supported.

	closer to the standard -- but now it won't work from the console!
	Removed 486asm.gls from the distribution, as it is *WAY* out of date.
1.24 -- Fixed a bug in I/O instructions having to do with size prefixes.  It
        seems the assembler was setting a flag without bothering to check it...
        Changed GROUP1-COMPILE to assemble 8 bit immediate operands when
        possible.

1.27 -- Fixed SHxD and BTx reg, reg (Serguei V. Jidkov <jsv@e-mail.ru>)
