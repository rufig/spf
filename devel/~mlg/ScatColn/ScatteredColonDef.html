Scattering a Colon Definition</H1></CENTER>

<H2>
The Problem</H2>
The technique presented here is used in a prefix notation Forth assembler
that performs initialization actions (variables resetting, etc.) every
time before processing a new instruction. The assembler has many switches
that get set according to the defaults and the instruction operands and
then determine what to do. Some switches are "functional": executing they
execute a Forth word, setting or resetting determines which word is to
be executed. (The switches are implemented as multi-cfa words.) Due to
these numerous switches definitions of instruction groups are as readable
as instruction formats, but the initialization code grows. Had the initialization
code been written as a separate definition, it would occupy two dense-typed
block screens; sequential files could not be a solution because one dense
screen of sequential file isn't better than two blocks.
<P>So, the problem is that initialization actions belong to two different
modules at the same time: to the module they initialize and to the general
initialization module. We want to distribute these actions so that they
will be located in the modules they initialize, but used as a single definition.
<H2>
The Solution</H2>
The solution scatters the code of the initialization definition over the
screens where the things to be initialized are used.
<BR>The words ... , ..: , and ;.. are used as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>: INIT ... &lt;some initialization actions> ;</TT>
<BR><TT>&lt;something></TT>
<BR><TT>..: INIT &lt;more initialization actions> ;..</TT>
<BR><TT>&lt;something></TT>
<BR><TT>..: INIT &lt;more initialization actions> ;..</TT>
<BR><TT>&lt;and so on></TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
The generated code looks like this:

<H2>
Implementation</H2>

<P><BR>The implementation code below is unstandard, but very portable.
<P>With the definitions:
<P><TT>\ fetch/store a reference that e.g. follows a BRANCH</TT>
<BR><TT>: REF@ ( orig -- dest ) DUP @ + ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
\ the branch addresses</TT>
<BR><TT>: REF! ( dest orig -- ) TUCK - SWAP ! ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are relative</TT>
<P><TT>\ add size of a compiled token</TT>
<BR><TT>: TOKEN+ ( addr -- addr' ) CELL+ ;</TT>
<P>We might define:
<P><TT>: >MARK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( -- orig ) HERE 0 , ;</TT>
<BR><TT>: >RESOLVE ( orig -- ) HERE SWAP REF! ;</TT>
<BR><TT>: &lt;MARK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( -- dest ) HERE ;</TT>
<BR><TT>: &lt;RESOLVE ( dest -- ) HERE CELL ALLOT REF! ;</TT>
<P>And now we can define:
<P><TT>: ... COMPILE BRANCH >MARK >RESOLVE ; IMMEDIATE</TT>
<BR><TT>: ..: ' >BODY TOKEN+ DUP REF@ SWAP >RESOLVE !CSP 400 ] ;</TT>
<BR><TT>: ;.. 400 ?PAIRS ?CSP COMPILE BRANCH &lt;RESOLVE [COMPILE] [ ;
IMMEDIATE</TT>
<P>In F-PC there may be some problems with long jumps and long addresses.
Note that a new branching word is defined:
<P><TT>: BRANCHL 2R> REF@ 2>R ;</TT>
<P>F-PC with its double-cell addresses isn't well-suited for return address
manipulations and code generation tricks. The F-PC code is given below:
<P><TT>anew scatter.seq</TT>
<P><TT>: REF@L ( orig-seg orig-off --- dest-seg dest-off )</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2DUP&nbsp;&nbsp;
2+ @L XSEG @ +&nbsp;&nbsp; -ROT&nbsp;&nbsp; @L ;</TT>
<BR><TT>: REF!L ( dest-seg dest-off orig-seg orig-off --- )</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2DUP
2>R&nbsp;&nbsp; !L&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XSEG @ - 2R> 2+ !L ;</TT>
<BR><TT>: TOKEN+ 2+ ;</TT>
<P><TT>: >MARKL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( -- Dorig ) XHERE 0 0 X, X, ;</TT>
<BR><TT>: >RESOLVEL ( Dorig -- ) XHERE 2SWAP REF!L ;</TT>
<BR><TT>: &lt;MARKL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( -- Ddest ) XHERE ;</TT>
<BR><TT>: &lt;RESOLVEL ( Ddest -- ) XHERE 0 0 X, X, REF!L ;</TT>
<P><TT>: BRANCHL 2R> REF@L 2>R ;</TT>
<BR><TT>: >TCODE ( cfa -- seg off ) >BODY @ XSEG @ + 0 ;</TT>
<P><TT>: ?PAIRS XOR ABORT" NON-PAIRED WORD" ;</TT>
<P><TT>: ... COMPILE BRANCHL >MARKL >RESOLVEL ; IMMEDIATE</TT>
<BR><TT>: ..: ' >TCODE TOKEN+ 2DUP REF@L 2SWAP >RESOLVEL !CSP 400 ] ;</TT>
<BR><TT>: ;.. 400 ?PAIRS ?CSP COMPILE BRANCHL &lt;RESOLVEL [COMPILE] [
; IMMEDIATE</TT>
<H2>
Why a Special Construct</H2>
The evident benefit of this tool is that programmer does not have to modify
the initialization definition when he adds a new mechanism to the growing
program. Deleting of a mechanism also becomes painless: if you do not load
a block, its initialization does not get compiled.
<P>In F-PC this problem is usually solved by means of DEFER variables.
We think that a special construct is better because it is:
<P>1) laconic;
<P>2) more readable: the purpose may be understood at the first glance;
<P>3) uses no auxiliary names (which have no meaning in itself).
<H2>
Conclusion</H2>

<P><BR>The technique presented here enables programmer to distribute fragments
of code that should execute as one definition across the modules they logically
belong to.
